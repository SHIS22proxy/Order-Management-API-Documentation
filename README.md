# Order Management API Documentation

## 1. Introduction

### Overview  
The **Order Management API** provides endpoints for handling the complete lifecycle of customer orders — from order creation and confirmation to tracking, updating, and fulfillment. It acts as the bridge between the shopping cart, inventory, and payment systems, ensuring orders are validated, processed, and traceable.

### Why It Matters  
Efficient order handling is core to any e-commerce operation. The Order Management API enables seamless coordination across sales channels, ensures data integrity, and improves customer satisfaction by delivering timely and accurate order information.

### Who This Guide is For  
This guide is intended for:
- Backend developers integrating order functionality  
- DevOps teams managing API services  
- QA testers validating checkout and order workflows  
- Product managers overseeing e-commerce backends  
- ERP integrators managing downstream logistics

## 2. Key Terminology

- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for an order  
- **Order Status**: Indicates order state (e.g., pending, confirmed, shipped, delivered)  
- **Line Item**: Individual product within an order  
- **Invoice**: A billing document generated after an order is confirmed  
- **Fulfillment**: The process of preparing and shipping the order  
- **Webhook**: An automated callback sent when an event occurs  
- **Payment Status**: Indicates whether an order is paid, unpaid, or refunded  
- **Shipping Info**: Details about delivery address and method

## 3. Technical Overview

### System Architecture

The Order Management API connects directly with the Shopping Cart API (for initiating orders), the Payment Gateway API (for processing transactions), and Inventory/Fulfillment systems (for order tracking and delivery).

4. Step-by-Step Guide or Workflow
4.1 Authenticate Requests
Use a bearer token for all order-related API calls:

http
Copy
Edit
Authorization: Bearer <token>
4.2 Create Order (POST)
http
Copy
Edit
POST /api/orders
Request Body:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "cart_id": "abc123",
  "user_id": "user789",
  "shipping_address": {
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "address": "123 Main St",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY",
    "zip": "10001",
    "country": "US"
  },
  "payment_method": "credit_card"
}
Response:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "order_id": "ORD12345",
  "status": "pending",
  "message": "Order received and pending payment."
}
4.3 Get Order by ID (GET)
http
Copy
Edit
GET /api/orders/ORD12345
Response:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "order_id": "ORD12345",
  "status": "confirmed",
  "total": 75.00,
  "payment_status": "paid",
  "shipping_status": "processing",
  "items": [
    {
      "product_id": "p001",
      "name": "USB Cable",
      "quantity": 2,
      "price": 10.00
    }
  ]
}
4.4 Update Order Status (PUT)
http
Copy
Edit
PUT /api/orders/ORD12345/status
Request Body:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "status": "shipped"
}
4.5 Cancel Order (DELETE)
http
Copy
Edit
DELETE /api/orders/ORD12345
Response:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "message": "Order ORD12345 cancelled successfully."
}
4.6 List All Orders (GET)
http
Copy
Edit
GET /api/orders?user_id=user789&status=confirmed
5. Best Practices
Use Status Lifecycle: e.g., pending → confirmed → shipped → delivered

Implement Idempotency: Prevent duplicate orders on retry

Asynchronous Fulfillment: Use message queues to decouple order processing

Secure Payment Details: Never store full card info directly

Log Order Events: Maintain audit logs for traceability

Rate Limiting: Prevent abuse on order endpoints

Email Notifications: Notify users on key order status changes

6. Common Issues & Troubleshooting
Issue	Cause	Resolution
404 Not Found	Invalid Order ID	Double-check order reference
409 Conflict	Order already processed	Check status before attempting update
400 Bad Request	Missing or malformed data	Validate against order schema
500 Internal Error	Payment or DB failure	Log error and retry or escalate
